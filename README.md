# Doz (XO)
XO game with C++ and C#

### This project has been implemented in four phases
1. [Explanation of phase 1](#explanation-of-phase-1)
2. [Explanation of phase 2](#explanation-of-phase-2)
3. [Explanation of phase 3](#explanation-of-phase-3)
4. [Explanation of phase 4](#explanation-of-phase-4)


## Explanation of phase 1 <a name="explanation-of-phase-1"></a>

In this phase we create an XO game with C++ with the following top features:

- Play XO game with two players.
- Play music and colors in cmd.


## Explanation of phase 2 <a name="explanation-of-phase-2"></a>

In this phase we create an XO game with C++ that has more features than phase 1, including these features:

- Create a table with a selected size (e.g. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5).
- Playing in two to four player mode.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a better way to create the board of the game (can you find it? If you can, create a fork and fix that :)!).


## Explanation of phase 3 <a name="explanation-of-phase-3"></a>

In this phase, we create an XO game with C++ that we can play with the computer:

- This code uses the min and max algorithm to play with the computer.
- Play with both human and computer.


## Explanation of phase 4 <a name="explanation-of-phase-4"></a>

In this phase, we use C# Windows Form to create a GUI for our game:

- Use Windows Form to create a GUI.
- Suggesting the best move min and max algorithm.
- Play with computer (min and max algorithm) and human.
